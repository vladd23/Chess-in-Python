# Chess-in-Python

This is a personal project for a simple chess game created in Python using the pygame library. The game currently only supports player versus player mode, and can be played by running the main.py file. To restart the game, simply press the R key on your keyboard. Additionally, it's worth noting that the game's pawn currently only promotes to a queen, and there is no undo function. However, I am working on implementing the undo function. Until then, every mistake would start the game from zero.
